# Slack-Game ðŸš€

ðŸ¤– A Slack Bot that uses Slack Api to respond to a slack commands from the node app hosted on Heroku.

User can start the game using slash commands as shown in below image.
More info about the slack Api can be found out at Slack's API site.
Since this was my first node project , i took help from this awesome project with awesome documentation(https://github.com/salemohamedo/Slack-Tic-Tac-Toe).Since the project is hosted on Heroku Free Tier,it will take time for the first time to start.
&nbsp;

Also i built the app in public and documented in twitter thread for everyone to see(https://twitter.com/ankitkr82/status/1366975367416664066).

Below are some of the screenshots of my app.
